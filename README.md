Experience using Pygame 1.9.2 and python 3.4.3

I once tried to make a game like metal-slug (and many others) using pygame,
however, back then I didn't know about programming or object orientation,
and I still not much of a pro.

So this was my first experience doing so. I also had some goals in mind,
like making it scalable at any resolution. It was my first time with
pixel art and I laughed at how stupid the little terrorist looks like in my first tries.
I had my own thoughts about how an engine works since there is no tutorial of these things work,
so I am quite proud of what I achieved here.

The code is super messy, non-pythonic, and hard to figure out what's happening,
but that's what you'd expect from a new programmer.
